Hey EveryOne!


As you have already used to App and understand the useRef Hook concept.

Lets have a quick summary:
	useRef() only return one items, an object called current so you can perform any styling, manipulating on current object.
	In React, we can add a ref attribute(see in App Example #1) to access it directly in the DOM.

[Optional]
	You can use useState with useRef to keep track of states (See in Example #2)
 
So now You have to perform Some Extra task on this App.

The task listed are :-

1. In First Example,  you have to replace the text with any image of your choice when button is pressed.

2. In Second Example, using useRef create a stopwatch which run for every 10s.




Thankyou.
